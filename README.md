# Background

ACME is a startup which focuses on building successful software products mainly operating in the SaaS field. ACMEâ€™s unique approach is to build products by first understanding the customer's needs and trying to fill the spot in the market where there is a demand. Towards this end, ACME is interested in building an internal tool that the team can monitor for potential investment ideas by closely understanding if there is a demand for a business problem, or a request stemming from a clear need.
ACME believes Twitter is a low barrier medium for detecting and monitoring potential demand for ideas that might be valuable to invest.

# Goal(s):

Build a software that searches Twitter for the term "request for startup" and extracts information, in other words tweets, then stores this information in a very simple file format, such as a CSV file or a simple text file, and displays results in a simple web interface.
Hint: You don't need to use the official Twitter API for this.

# Success Metrics:
Every relevant information about tweets should be visible, such as author, date, tweet contents, number of likes, number of retweets and number of discussions.

# Bonus(es):
Sort by total number of retweets, likes, and discussions and then date in descending order.
